# BLOCK 15 Workshop

This repo contains my solution and a copy (retyped from cohort-repo solution) to block 15 workshop: Froyo Orders.

I have make two seperate JS files and two seperate HTML where one part is a retyped version while the other is where I experimented with my own way of coding.

Below are the explanation of each files:
1. froyo-test.js          = my own code to solve this Froyo Orders;
2. test-index.html        = html file that links to froyo-test.js
3. index-solutioncopy.js  = retyped cohort solution to see how it actually works
4. index-solutioncopy.js  = html file that links to index-solutioncopy.js
5. previous-block.js      = js file from previous block's workshop for referencing purposes.
